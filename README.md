## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Sudoku solver using the **backtracking** algorithm. The solver fills a 9Ã—9 Sudoku grid so that each row, column, and 3Ã—3 subgrid contains digits 1â€“9 exactly once. The implementation can be used as a baseline for comparing brute-force, human-strategy, or optimized solvers.
